# Covid_Detection
I have used transfer learning and ensambling techniques to get the high accuracy in classifying a Chest X-ray into 3 classes namely COVID/NORMAL/PNEUMONIA

The follwing repository contains the dataset (obtained from kaggle.

## Download and change the trainig,test,valid data directory accordingly before running the code to avoid errors. Same goes while loading models.

Since upload limit is 100mb and some models were above that so you will have to Run the code in Transfer learning directory in order to generate the model as 
a h5 (for the ones not in modell folder) file which will be used in ensambling and flask app and place the file in model folder/flask folder and give its path while 
loading the model in ensamble file.
